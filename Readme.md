#TidyTuesday (https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday) is a social coding project in R that challenges data scientists to analyze a new dataset each week! This repository houses some of my analyses.

One of the key features of my approach is to think creatively about the kinds of questions a dataset can answer - and this has often involved seeking out additional sources of data. For example, Given data about characters in the Simpsons, I used a machine learning model to impute the gender of the actors who played these characters, revealing a strong gender bias in the guest stars on the Simpsons.
