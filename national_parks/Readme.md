This #TidyTuesday challenged us to explore national park data.

FiveThirtyEight had reported that national parks "have never been more popular." https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-national-parks-have-never-been-more-popular/

I found this isn't right. What's actually happening is the US population is growing fast. When you adjust for population, national park attendance has been declining since the mid-1980s.

I also checked whether people are traveling more to visit state parks. I did this by correlating visitors to a state's park with the state's population. The basic idea is that a lower correlation should indicate that visitors are traveling more outside the state they live in -- although this is admittedly a rough proxy. I found, somewhat surprisingly, that the correlation is going UP over time, which may suggest that people are traveling LESS to visit state parks, now preferring to visit parks in their hometown.
